This course [(see here)](https://github.com/tiagodsferreira/RIntro_4h) provides a short introduction to the R programming language.
The course covers the following topics: 
- **Basic functioning of R and RStudio**
- **Operators and objects**
- **Data structures**
- **Built-in functions for basic statistics**
- **Useful packages**


## What is R?
- Open-source statistical software  
- Computational environment and programming language  
- Tool for statistical analysis and data visualization  

## SPSS vs R
- SPSS:  
Easy to use (point-and-click)   
Basic graphics   
Limited statitiscal procedures   
Inflexible programming

- R:  
More difficult to use (syntax-based)   
Professional graphics    
Unlimited statistical procedures   
Flexible programming  

## Getting and installing R and RStudio
R and RStudio are free to download and compatible with the main operating systems:

1. [Download R](http://cran.r-project.org/)  
2. [Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/)

R and RStudio are compatible with the main OS's:  
- Windows (PC)

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/tiago/Google Drive/FPCEUP/R trainning/FPCEUP_R1/r.png")
```

NOTE: GitHub Pages wonâ€™t render local images from your C: drive. 
Later, move the image to your repository (e.g., assets/images/r.png) 
and reference it relatively: 
![R environment](assets/images/r.png)
