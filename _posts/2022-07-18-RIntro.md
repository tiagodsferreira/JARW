- **Operators and objects**
- **Data structures**
- **Built-in functions for basic statistics**
- **Useful packages**


## What is R?
- Open-source statistical software  
- Computational environment and programming language  
- Tool for statistical analysis and data visualization  

## SPSS vs R
- SPSS:  
Easy to use (point-and-click)   
Basic graphics   
Limited statitiscal procedures   
Inflexible programming

- R:  
More difficult to use (syntax-based)   
Professional graphics    
Unlimited statistical procedures   
Flexible programming  

## Getting and installing R and RStudio
R and RStudio are free to download and compatible with the main operating systems:

1. [Download R](http://cran.r-project.org/)  
2. [Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/)
