The GPRI is a screening instrument used by genetic-health professionals to identify genetic testing applicants who may need additional psychosocial support. In this post I present the adaptation and validation process of the GPRI.

## The data analysis [(see here)](https://github.com/tiagodsferreira/together_repo/blob/main/GPRI_syntax.R) include:
- Missing data analysis
- Descriptive statistics;  
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis; 
- Reliability analysis
- Convergent validity; 

## Results overview
The GPRI three-factor structure was confirmed. Two GPRI factors exhibited good internal consistency, but one factor (Personal/family history of/Loss to Cancer) showed problems in internal consistency, discriminant, and convergent validity. 

*NOTE:* The manuscript (Gomes et al., under review) reporting these analysis is currently under peer review.
