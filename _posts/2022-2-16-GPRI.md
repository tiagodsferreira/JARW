The GPRI is a screening instrument used by genetic-health professionals to identify genetic testing applicants who may need additional psychosocial support. In this post I present the adaptation and validation process of the GPRI.

## The data analysis [(see here)](https://github.com/tiagodsferreira/together_repo/blob/main/GPRI_syntax.R) include:
- Missing data analysis
- Descriptive statistics;  
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis;
- Reliability analysis
- Convergent validity;

## Results overview
A brief report of descriptive statistics can be found [here](https://github.com/tiagodsferreira/together_repo/blob/5ce3a8515bc4ce1c859463dc1070b9024e40f4ca/DA_report.md). Overall, the results from cofirmatory factor analysis confirmed the GPRI three-factor structure. Two GPRI factors exhibited good internal consistency, but one factor (Personal/family history of/Loss to Cancer) showed problems in internal consistency, discriminant, and convergent validity.

*NOTE:* The manuscript (Gomes et al., 2022) reporting these analysis is currently under peer review.
