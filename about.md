# Who am I?

Iâ€™m a professor at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of the University of Porto (FPCEUP), where I also completed my Ph.D. in Psychology. My research focuses on socio-emotional development in childhood, the role of family and school relationships, and how skills like empathy and prosocial behavior contribute to the development of ecological awareness in children and adolescents. In parallel, I specialize in applied statistics and data analysis, with expertise in psychometrics, structural equation modeling, longitudinal and multilevel modeling, and machine learning. I enjoy teaching and have led R workshops and advanced courses in data analysis for the social sciences. I'm involved in several research projects and have been contributing to [publications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tiago_Ferreira5/research) in national and international peer-reviewed journals. 

## Purpose of this webpage
