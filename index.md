Welcome to my webpage!

This space is where I share my teaching materials, code, and resources that I develop for my courses and research. Youâ€™ll also find updates on my latest research outputs, including papers, talks, and ongoing projects.

My work sits at the intersection of psychology, education, and data scienceâ€”ranging from socio-emotional development in children to advanced statistical modeling and machine learning. I use this webpage as a hub to make my work more accessible, whether youâ€™re a student, researcher, or just curious about the topics I study.

Feel free to explore, use the materials, and check out my latest updates. My first post is already live â€” enjoy!
