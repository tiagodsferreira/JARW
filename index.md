Welcome to my webpage!

This space is where I share my teaching materials, code, and resources that I develop for my courses and research. You’ll also find updates on my latest research outputs, including papers, talks, and ongoing projects.

My work sits at the intersection of psychology, education, and data science—ranging from socio-emotional development in children to advanced statistical modeling and machine learning. I use this webpage as a hub to make my work more accessible, whether you’re a student, researcher, or just curious about the topics I study.

Feel free to explore, use the materials, and check out my latest updates. My first post is already live — enjoy!
